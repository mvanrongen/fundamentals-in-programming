# Overview

These sessions are intended to enable you to perform core programming techniques appropriately and confidently using R.

## Core aims
:::highlight
By the end of this course you should be comfortable with:

1. creating `for` loops
2. creating nested loops
3. working with conditional statements
4. creating `while` loops
5. creating your own functions
:::

## Core topics

1. [Loops](#loops-intro)
2. [Functions](#functions-intro)

## Datasets {#index-datasets}

This course uses various data sets. The easiest way of accessing these is by creating an R-project in RStudio. Then download the `data` folder [here](data.zip) by right-clicking on the link and <kbd>Save as...</kbd>. Next unzip the file and copy it into your working directory. Your data should then be accessible via `<working-directory-name>/data/raw`.
